# 01 — Product Vision

## 1.1 Problem Statement
Engineers need a desktop toolchain to simulate EV subsystems (battery pack, BMS, drive, thermal, auxiliaries), visualize results, and interoperate with industry-standard data formats (MDF/MDF4/DAT) and HIL/bench data.

## 1.2 Stakeholders
- **End Users**: EV simulation engineers, data analysts.
- **Maintainers**: Project core team (RRK0123), CI maintainers.
- **Integrators**: HIL/DAQ operators, test lab personnel.
- **Reviewers**: QA, compliance, external auditors.

## 1.3 Goals (Top-Level)
- G1. Accurate, reproducible simulations with configurable scenarios.
- G2. First-class data interop: import/export MDF4/MDF/DAT.
- G3. Usable UI with live progress and rich plots.
- G4. Extensibility: new models/solvers/plugins without core changes.

## 1.4 Non-Goals
- ECU firmware and embedded control design.
- Cloud-only execution (desktop is primary; cloud optional).

## 1.5 Glossary (excerpt)
- **MDF/MDF4**: ASAM Measurement Data Format.
- **Canonical timeseries schema**: Project’s normalized channel set and metadata.
- **Scenario**: Named bundle of parameters, drive cycle, and environment.
